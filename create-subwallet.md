Now you will be shown a seed phrase together with the option to back it up. Once you have saved and stored it in a safe place, choose **I have kept it somewhere safe**.

!!! Caution
    You should never share your seed phrase (mnemonic) or private key with anyone. This gives them direct access to your funds.
